# Introduction

This is my first time writing an Rmarkdown. I hope it works!

1. **List of things**
    - *Thing 1*
    - *Thing 2*
2. **List of other things, but not italicised**
    - Another thing 1
    - Another thing 2

## Plot

Here is a simple plot. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(1:20, 20:1)
```
